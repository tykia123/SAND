Pray Thee
By my troth
Going to siege
My peerless paramour
My sweeting
God spede you
Fare thee well
I cry your mercy
Gramercy
Beshrew thee!
A plague upon thee!
What ho!
Couch a hogshead
Fantastic!
You shall not pass!
It is only a flesh wound
Have fun storming the castle!
But why is the rum gone?
Treasure!
Fear me, if you dare!
Toss a coin!
Burn butcher, burn!
My precious...
Γεια σου Ελλάδα!
Bigger and better
Tyrion would love it!
TROJANS!
